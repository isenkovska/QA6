// A ring is an area limited by two circles that have the same center but different radius. 
// Your task is to count if our point is lying at coordinate.
// (the border of the ring is not included).
//  The equation of a circle of radius r and centre the origin is   ( x2 + y2 = r2 );

// function solution (inner, outer, x, y) {
//    return ( x ** 2 + y ** 2 > inner ** 2 &&  x ** 2 + y ** 2  < outer ** 2);  
// }
// console.log(1, 3, 1, 0);  //Output (true)
